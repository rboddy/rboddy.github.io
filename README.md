## So How do we Document on Github?

There are two main ways to document on Github. They are:
* Create a README.md
* Create a Wiki

But wait! That's stuff we know right? As users of Github, we check out READMEs and Wikis all the time. But how do we make it look readable for the public (like this one)?

## Github Markdown

Oh sick, there's markdown. I can dig it. I like style. Click [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to learn all about that markdown. It's pretty generic stuff. It does, however, offer some pretty neat features for documentation. Such as:

### Syntax Highlighting:

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
That's pretty neat.

### Task Lists:

- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item

We can populate these with all kinds of fun features.

### Images:

Yeah, that's Yaktocat. I don't know his relation to Octocat, but he seems pretty sweet.
